      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <h3>Effective from November 20, 2022</h3>
      <p>Wecome to brandonlind.com's Privacy Policy</p>

      <h4>The gist of it</h4>
      <p>
        This is a personal website ("brandonlind.com"), owned and maintained
        by Brandon Lind ("I", "my", "me"). I use analytics to understand my
        website traffic and usage patterns. I do not use the data for anything
        other than to understand the anonomized patterns
        (i.e. what are the most common internet browsers, devices, screen sizes,
        regional origins of traffic, referring websites, etc.).
      </p>

      <h4>What is collected?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Information you provide me when submitting your name using the Contact Me form.</li>
        <li>
          When you visit I may collect aggregated information, such as browsing
          and 'click-stream' activity, session heatmaps and scrolls, non-identifying
          Personal Information regarding your device such as the operating system, internet browser,
          screen resolution, language and keyboard settings, internet service provider,
          referring/exit pages, date/time stamps, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Data Sharing?</h4>
      <p>Nope, it is strictly for me to understand my website's traffic and usage patterns.</p>

      <h4>Information Storage</h4>
      <p>
        The data collected in the "What is collected?" section is stored and processed by a
        third-party service provider (such as Google Analytics). The service provider has
        committed to keeping the information protected and secured, in accordance with industry
        standards and regardless of any lesser legal requirements which may apply in their jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h4>Want to delete your data?</h4>
      <p>
        You can request deletion of your data by submitting a request using the
        <a href="/contact">Contact Me</a> form.
      </p>

      <h4>Third-party websites</h4>
      <p>
        My website may contain links to other websites or services. I am not responsible
        for such websites' or services' privacy practices. I encourage you to be aware when
        you leave my website to read the privacy statements of each and every website and
        service you visit before providing your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy
        does not apply to such linked third party websites and services.
      </p>

      <h4>Updates</h4>
      <p>
        I may update this Privacy Policy at any time and will not notify you
        (since I don't collect that type of information).
